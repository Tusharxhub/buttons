# Buttons

A small UI playground showcasing modern, animated button styles for web projects.[web:6]  
Live demo: https://buttons-umber.vercel.app

## Features

- Multiple button variants (primary, secondary, destructive, outline, ghost, link).[web:6]  
- Extra visual “effects” such as shine, ring hover, expand icon, gooey gradients, and animated underlines.[web:6]  
- Different sizes (default, small, large, icon) to fit various layouts.[web:6]  
- Built with a single, extensible button component so styles are easy to reuse in other projects.[web:6]  

## Tech Stack

- HTML/CSS and modern utility classes for layout and effects.  
- Deployed on Vercel for quick previews and sharing.[web:4]

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Tusharxhub/buttons.git
   cd buttons
   ```

2. Open the main HTML file in your browser (for example `index.html`) to view the buttons gallery.

3. Copy any button markup and corresponding CSS into your own project to reuse a design.

## Usage

- Pick a button style from the demo and copy its HTML and CSS into your project.  
- Adjust text, icons, and colors to match your design system.  
- For frameworks (React, Next.js, etc.), wrap the button markup into a component and pass `children`/`onClick` as props.

## Roadmap

- Add more button presets (loading states, icon-only, social buttons).  
- Document each variant with short code snippets.  
- Add dark/light mode examples.
